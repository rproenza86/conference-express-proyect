## Overview

Although Node.js is a popular platform for building web services, it wasn't designed for simple website development.

Express.js is a fast, minimalist framework that sits on top of Node.js and allows you to build powerful single and multi-page web applications and websites.

In this training, I had set up the framework and build a realistic website with these technologies. Trained how to build a basic application with templating engines; create more flexible, modular code with conditional statements; work with POST requests, and more.

## Objectives

- Creating a server with Express and pure Node.js
- Handling errors in Express
- Creating routes
- Using templates
- Working with the Pug template engine
- Implementing the site structure and logic
- Working with conditionals
- Dealing with POST requests
- Sanitizing user inputs and handling form errors
